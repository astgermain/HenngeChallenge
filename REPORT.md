## I used React/Next.js to complete this challenge.
## Run the project
### Make sure you have node installed
### npm install
### npm run dev

## Development notes
### I didn't implement an email sort by clicking fields such as to, from, date as I felt it was better left off with out a solid data set.
### Added support for selecting a date range.
### Responsive for most viewports.
### Included a button to added or remove emails as there is no db to pull data from.
